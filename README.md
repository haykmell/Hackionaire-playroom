# Playroom ü§ñ



### This is a website of `Quizzes and Games` where we have made the website for children upto 12-13 years of age. They can gain some knowledge by performing quiz and according to their scores they can play various games that we have build to make it interesting for them. ‚è≤Ô∏è

 We have 6 games - HexGL, Ancient Beast, Pacman-Canvas,BreakLock, 3D Car Racer üèéÔ∏è and Pixel Defense. For example If someone scores 15/15 then Ancient beast along with all other games will be unlocked , If someone scores 12/15 car racer along with  will be unlocked, if someone scores 10/15 BreakLock along with games of all the scores below it will be unlocked , If someone scores 8/15 PixelDefense along with games of all the scores below it will be unlocked and if someone scores 5/15 HexGL along with games of all the scores below it  will be unlocked, if less than that then only one game i.e. Pacman-Canvas will be unlocked. Also we have contact page where children can contact us for including the game that they desire .


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
